This was a project I created for my Virtual Worlds class.

The idea behind the project was to create a 3D keyboard model that was fully functional and playable.

I created the model in Processing, a computer language that builds on Java, but uses a simplified syntax and graphics programming model.

To play the first octave, press Q W E R with your left fingers and T Y U I with your right fingers.
To play the sharps in the first octave, press 2 3 with your left fingers and 5 6 7 with your right fingers.
To play the second octave, press Z X C V with your left fingers and B N M , with your right fingers.
To play the sharps in the second octave, press S D with your left fingers and G H J with your right fingers.

You can press multiple keys at the same time to create chords.

Enjoy!
